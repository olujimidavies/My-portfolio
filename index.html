          <h1>
            Hello, my name is Damilola Agbebiyi! <img src="hand_wave.jpg" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I am Damilola Agbebiyi, a senior at Oklahoma State University, working towards a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Information Assurance. With a current GPA of 3.60, I have built a strong foundation in programming languages such as SQL, Python, C++, and JavaScript, alongside practical experience in cloud computing and cybersecurity.

            Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have leveraged my technical expertise to improve processes and lead innovative projects. During my internship as an Area Manager at Amazon, I increased key operational metrics by nearly 50% and developed a web-based tool to streamline productivity using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My role as an IT Helpdesk assistant has further honed my skills in customer support and systems troubleshooting.

            I am passionate about software development and have participated in several key projects, including developing a React-based student career helper and a wellness website that connects users to local activities (as part of the CodePath coding bootcamp). My leadership extends to my involvement as Executive Secretary for the African American Business Student Association and OSU Menâ€™s Club Soccer, where I thrive in collaborative environments and contribute to the success of my teams.

            With certifications in AWS Cloud Essentials and IBM Front-End Development, I am ready to apply my skills in the software engineering or cybersecurity field, focusing on innovation, efficiency, and impactful solutions.
